# Mini Challenge 2: Citizen Science to the Rescue

This project aims to provide visual analytics to help analyze radiation contamination in St. Himark following an incident at a nuclear plant. It uses data from stationary and mobile sensors.

## About

Following an earthquake that caused a leak at the Always Safe nuclear plant, St. Himark is facing a radioactive contamination crisis. This project uses data collected from stationary government sensors and mobile citizen sensors to help the city's emergency management team identify areas needing monitoring, cleanup or evacuation. 

The visual analytics approach combines the sensor data to provide insights into radiation levels across time and location.

## Data

The data covers April 6-10, 2020, in 5-second intervals. It includes:

- Timestamp
- Radiation value
- Sensor ID
- Longitude & Latitude
- User ID (for mobile sensors)   

There are:

- 9 stationary sensors
- 50 mobile sensors

## Visualizations 

Visualizations are built using D3.js and include:

- Animated heatmap showing radiation over time 
- Area chart overlaying sensors on a map
- Line charts for individual sensors
- Radar charts to detect uncertainties 
- Tracking sensor locations and movements
- Comparison of static and mobile sensors

## Features

Key features:

- Identify areas with elevated radiation
- Understand uncertainty in measurements
- Evaluate the impact of contamination events
- Determine sensor reliability
- Locate contamination hotspots
- Track contaminated vehicle movement
- Recommend optimal sensor placements
- Compare static and mobile sensor networks
